# sketch

Created a drawing canvas based on https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project.

It utilizes JavaScript to create a grid of square divs in a fixed container. Hovering over each cell will leave a pixilated trail through the grid, allowing users to draw on it.

The clear button will wipe the board of all trails and revert it back to it's original state.  
The reset button will clear the board while prompting the user to specify the number of cells they want in the grid.  

What I learned:  
Used DOM manipulation to create a grid system 
Applied CSS grid and flex to organize and format the web page
Implemented JavaScript events, allowing user to interact with the canvas through the cursor and buttons

To Dos:  
Size slider/prompter  
Different color options  
Formatting
