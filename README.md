# sketch

Created a drawing canvas based on https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project.

It utilizes JavaScript to create a grid of square divs in a fixed container. Hovering over each cell will leave a pixilated trail through the grid, allowing users to draw on it.

The clear button will wipe the board of all trails and revert it back to it's original state.  
The reset button will clear the board while prompting the user to specify the number of cells they want in the grid.  

What I learned:  
Using DOM manipulation to create a grid system through loops and functions  
Applied CSS to create a fixed grid  
Implemented JavaScript events that will interact with the grid through buttons and cursor
